        <h3>Angular</h3>
        <p className="lead">Angular is the powerhouseâ€”built by Google, itâ€™s opinionated, full-featured, and perfect for enterprise-grade applications. Think of it as the heavyweight champ who brings everything to the table (sometimes more than you asked for).</p>
        <h3>React</h3>
        <p className="lead">React is the cool kid from Facebookâ€”flexible, component-driven, and wildly popular. It doesnâ€™t tell you how to build your app, just gives you the tools and lets you paint your masterpiece (or spaghetti, your call ðŸ˜…).</p>
        <h3>Vue</h3>
        <p className="lead">Vue is the underdog turned superstarâ€”lightweight, elegant, and incredibly beginner-friendly. Itâ€™s like that quiet student who turns out to be a genius.</p>
