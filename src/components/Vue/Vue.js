            <p className="lead">Vue is a progressive JavaScript framework that’s designed to be approachable, versatile, and incredibly efficient. Created by Evan You, Vue offers the best of both worlds—combining the simplicity of vanilla JavaScript with the power of modern front-end tools. Its gentle learning curve makes it a favorite among beginners, while its advanced features like reactive data binding, computed properties, and component-based architecture appeal to seasoned developers. Vue is highly adaptable—you can use it to enhance a single page or scale it into a full-blown application using its official ecosystem tools like Vue Router and Vuex.</p>
